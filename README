Reinforcement Learning For Revenue Management

----------------------------------------------

This repo currently has 2 files of importance:

Customers.py includes the class Customer() which has attribute 'threshold'. The attribute can be set exactly or through a random linearly decreasing probability function through methods of the class.

test_notebook.ipynb is a notebook showing examples and tests of current classes and methods. This ensures that our code is working as intended.

-----------------------------------------------

I will update this Repo as I become more comfortable with object orientaited programming within python and using git!
The aim is that I will convert all my notebooks from my PhD into python files/classes that can be used those interested.
