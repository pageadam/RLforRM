Reinforcement Learning For Revenue Management

----------------------------------------------

This repo currently has 2 files of importance:

Customer.py includes a function that creates customer thresholds from a linearly decreasing probability mass function (pmf).

test_notebook.ipynb is a notbook showcaseing how current functions work, and allows me to make sure the functions are running correctly.

-----------------------------------------------

I will update this Repo as I become more comfortable with object orientaited programming within python and using git!
The aim is that I will convert all my notebooks from my PhD into python files/calsses that can be used those interested.
