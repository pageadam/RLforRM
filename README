Reinforcement Learning For Revenue Management

----------------------------------------------

This repo currently has 2 files of importance:

Customers.py includes the class Customer() which has attributes 'threshold', 'lead_time' and 'LoS'. 
    - The 'threshold' attribute shows a customer's willingness to pay. It can be set exactly or through a random linearly decreasing probability mass function using methods of the class.
    - The 'lead_time' attribute shows the time in days between a customer booking and arriving in the car park. This attribute can be assigned exactly or through a discrete uniform distribution using class methods.
    -The 'LoS' attribute shows the duration, in days, that a customer willl be staying in the car park. This attribute can be assigned exactly or through a discrete uniform distribution using class methods.

test_notebook.ipynb is a notebook showing examples and tests of current classes and methods. This ensures that our code is working as intended. Currently tested:
    - Customers:
        - .getThreshold()
        - .setThresholdLinear()
        - .getLeadTime()
        - .setLeadTimeUniform()
        - .getLoS()
        - .setLoSUniform()

I will update this Repo as I become more comfortable with object orientaited programming within python and using git!
The aim is that I will convert all my notebooks from my PhD into python files/classes that can be used those interested.
